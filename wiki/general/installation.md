## Installation

## Create the project
Launchpad is a Composer project due to that it is possible to create a new project using the framework in one command line:
[`composer create-project wp-launchpad/launchpad my-plugin`](https://packagist.org/packages/wp-launchpad/launchpad)

Once you done that command the lastest version of the framework will be fetched and installed on your computer.
You will have then to enter the folder from the project and initialize it.

## Initalize the project
To initialize the project you will have to launch the following command:
`bin/generator initialize`
This command comes from the [`wp-launchpad/laucnhpad-take-off`](https://packagist.org/packages/wp-launchpad/launchpad-take-off) library and you can check the library to know each option avalable.
However if you don't know the command well you can execute it without parameters and it will ask you required ones.
